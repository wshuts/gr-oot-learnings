***
correct command syntax:
vcpkg integrate install

https://enjoi.dev/posts/2021-09-15-gnu-radio-on-everything/
has this command transposed
***
vcpkg integrated with visual studio 2022:

expects to find a manifest in the solution directory

the gnu-radio setup expects a system-defined package directory
